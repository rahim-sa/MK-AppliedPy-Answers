## 1. Dataclasses Deep Dive

Dataclasses (@dataclass) simplify class creation by auto-generating boilerplate methods like __init__, __repr__, and __eq__. 
    
### When and Why to Use Dataclasses

#### They are ideal for:
   - Data-heavy classes (e.g., configurations, DTOs, records).
   
   - Reducing repetitive code (no manual __init__/__repr__).
   
   - Enforcing type hints (improves IDE support and readability).
    
Dataclasses, introduced in Python 3.7, simplify class creation by automatically generating special methods like `__init__()`, `__repr__()`, and `__eq__()`. They are particularly useful for classes that primarily store data.

### `frozen` and `slots` Parameters

- **`frozen=True`**: Makes instances immutable by preventing modification of fields after creation. This is beneficial for creating hashable objects and ensuring data integrity.

- **`slots=True`**: Reduces memory usage by preventing the creation of `__dict__` for each instance, leading to faster attribute access and lower memory footprint. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### Memory Efficiency Comparison

Using `slots=True` can significantly reduce memory usage, especially when creating many instances of a class. It eliminates the per-instance `__dict__`, which can be substantial in large-scale applications.

### Immutability Benefits

Immutable objects (`frozen=True`) are thread-safe and can be used as dictionary keys or set elements. They help prevent accidental modifications, leading to more predictable and bug-resistant code.

### Inheritance Behavior

When using `slots=True`, subclasses must also define `__slots__` if they introduce new attributes. Otherwise, the benefits of `slots` are lost in the subclass.

### Performance Considerations

- **Initialization**: Dataclasses provide faster and cleaner initialization compared to manually writing `__init__` methods.

- **Attribute Access**: `slots=True` enhances attribute access speed due to fixed memory layout.

- **Immutability**: While `frozen=True` adds a slight overhead to prevent modifications, the trade-off is often worth it for the benefits of immutability.


#### When to Avoid Dataclasses

   - Need custom __init__ logic (override auto-generated methods).

   - Dynamic attributes required (conflicts with slots).

   - Inheritance complexities (dataclasses have strict rules).

 
 ### Performance Comparison

| Approach                | Memory Usage | Attribute Access Speed | Mutability  |
|-------------------------|--------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Regular Class           | Higher       | Slower                 | Mutable     |
| `@dataclass`            | Medium       | Medium                 | Mutable     |
| `@dataclass(slots=True)`| Low          | Fastest                | Mutable     |
| `@dataclass(frozen=True)`| Medium      | Medium                 | Immutable   |


### Discussion Topics

1. **When does memory optimization matter?**

   Memory optimization is crucial in applications with a large number of object instances, such as data processing or simulations, where reducing per-instance memory can lead to significant overall savings.

2. **How do frozen classes affect code design?**

   Frozen classes enforce immutability, leading to safer and more predictable code. They are ideal for representing fixed data structures and can prevent bugs related to unintended modifications.

3. **What are the trade-offs of using slots?**

   While `slots` improve memory efficiency and attribute access speed, they restrict dynamic attribute assignment and can complicate inheritance if not managed carefully.

## 2. Static Methods vs Class Methods

   A static method is like a normal function but belongs to a class. It does not access or modify the class or instance (self or cls). Used for utility functions that are related to the class but don't need class/instance data.
   
   A class method is bound to the class itself, not instances. It takes cls (the class) as the first parameter instead of self. Used for factory methods (alternative constructors) or when you need to access/modify class-level data.

### Differences Between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`

- **`@staticmethod`**: Defines a method that does not access or modify class or instance state. It behaves like a regular function but resides within the class's namespace.

- **`@classmethod`**: Receives the class (`cls`) as the first argument and can access or modify class state. It is often used for factory methods that instantiate the class in different ways. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### Key Differences

| Feature               | `@staticmethod`                          | `@classmethod`                           |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Access to state**   | ❌ No access to class/instance           | ✅ Can access/modify class state via `cls` |
| **First parameter**   | None (just regular args)                 | `cls` (class reference)                  |
| **Inheritance**       | Static (no polymorphic behavior)         | Dynamic (respects subclass overrides)    |
| **Typical Use Case**  | • Pure utility functions<br>• Stateless helpers | • Factory methods<br>• Class configurators |
| **Callable On**       | Class or instance (`Math.add()` or `m.add()`) | Class only (`Math.factory()`)           |


### Method Access Patterns

- **Static Method**: Called on the class or instance without any reference to the class or instance itself.

- **Class Method**: Called on the class or instance, with the class passed as the first argument.

### Inheritance Behavior

Class methods are polymorphic and respect inheritance hierarchies, meaning they can be overridden by subclasses. Static methods do not have this behavior since they do not receive any reference to the class.

#### Why Use Static & Class Methods?
### Use Cases

- **Static Methods**: Utility functions related to the class but not dependent on class or instance state.

- **Class Methods**: Alternative constructors or methods that need to access or modify class-level data.

### Design Implications

Choosing between static and class methods depends on whether the method needs to interact with class state. Using the appropriate decorator enhances code clarity and maintainability.



#### When to Use @staticmethod

✅ Utility functions (no need for self/cls):

    Example: MathUtils.add(), DateValidator.is_valid()
    ✅ Better code organization (keeps related functions in a class).
    ✅ Slightly faster than instance methods (no self overhead).

#### When to Use @classmethod

✅ Factory methods (alternative constructors):

    Example: BankAccount.from_json(), Person.from_birth_year()
    ✅ Class-level state modification:

    Example: Updating a shared config (Database.set_config()).
    ✅ Polymorphism in inheritance:

    cls refers to the subclass, allowing flexible overrides.

## 3. Pytest Fixtures Scope
Fixture scope in pytest determines how often a fixture gets created and destroyed during your tests.

### Available Scopes

Pytest fixtures support five different scopes that control how often a fixture is created and destroyed. Understanding these scopes is crucial for efficient test design and resource management. Pytest fixtures can have different scopes, determining how often the fixture is invoked:

- **Function**: Default scope; the fixture is invoked for each test function. Created and destroyed for each test function.

- **Class**: Invoked once per test class.

- **Module**: Invoked once per module.

- **Package**: Invoked once per package.

- **Session**: Invoked once per test session. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}


### Scope Characteristics and Use Cases

#### 1. Function Scope (default)
 
@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def fresh_data():
    return DataContainer()

#### Characteristics:

   - Created before each test function that uses it

   - Destroyed after the test completes

   - Most isolated option

#### Best for:

   - Test-specific data that shouldn't leak between tests

   - Mutable objects that tests modify

   - When tests need completely fresh state

#### 2. Class Scope
 
@pytest.fixture(scope="class")
def shared_setup():
    config = TestConfig()
    yield config
    config.cleanup()

#### Characteristics:

   - Created once per test class

   - Shared by all test methods in the class

   - Destroyed after last test in class completes

#### Best for:

 - Expensive setup shared by related test methods

 - When tests in a class need the same initial state

 - Integration tests with class-level setup

#### 3. Module Scope
 
@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def mock_server():
    server = MockServer()
    yield server
    server.shutdown()

#### Characteristics:

   - Created once per test module (file)

   - Shared by all tests in the module

   - Destroyed after last test in module completes

#### Best for:

   - Shared resources that are expensive to create

   - Database connections that can be reused

   - External service mocks

#### 4. Package Scope
 
@pytest.fixture(scope="package")
def test_config():
    return load_test_config()

#### Characteristics:

   - Created once per test package

   - Shared by all tests in package

   - Destroyed after last test in package completes

#### Best for:

   - Package-wide configuration

   - Resources shared across multiple test modules

   - Rarely used compared to other scopes

#### 5. Session Scope
 
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def database_connection():
    conn = create_db_connection()
    yield conn
    conn.close()

#### Characteristics:

   - Created once at test session start

   - Shared by all tests in the session

   - Destroyed at end of test session

#### Best for:

   - Very expensive resources (database connections, Docker containers)

   - Read-only resources that can be safely shared

   - Global test configurations


### Resource Management

Choosing the appropriate fixture scope helps manage resources efficiently. For example, a database connection can be established once per session, while temporary files might be created for each test function.

### Performance Impact

Using broader scopes (like session) can improve test performance by reducing setup and teardown overhead. However, it may introduce shared state, which needs careful management to avoid test interference.

### State Handling

Fixtures with narrower scopes provide better isolation, ensuring that tests do not affect each other's state. This is crucial for maintaining test reliability and reproducibility.

## 4. Property Decorators
Property decorators in Python provide a way to implement getter, setter, and deleter methods for class attributes while maintaining a clean interface. They're part of Python's approach to encapsulation and data validation.

### Types of Property Decorators

- **`@property`**: Defines a getter method, allowing attribute access.

  **Purpose**: Creates a read-only property or computes a value dynamically

    #### Use cases:
    - Computed properties (values derived from other attributes)
    - Read-only attributes
    - Encapsulating internal representation
    - Adding validation when getting a value
  

- **`@<property>.setter`**: Defines a setter method, allowing attribute assignment.
 
  **Purpose**: Allows controlled modification of an attribute

    #### Use cases:
    - Validation before setting a value
    - Maintaining data consistency
    - Triggering side effects when values change
      

- **`@<property>.deleter`**: Defines a deleter method, allowing attribute deletion. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
 
  **Purpose**: Controls what happens when an attribute is deleted

    #### Use cases:
    - Cleanup operations
    - Preventing deletion of critical attributes
    - Implementing special deletion behavior


#### Example Combining All Three:
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self._balance = balance  # Internal storage (convention: underscore = "private")

    @property
    def balance(self):  # Getter: Controls read access
        print("Accessing balance...")  # Optional logging
        return self._balance  # Returns the stored value

    @balance.setter
    def balance(self, value):  # Setter: Controls write access
        if value < 0:  # Validation: Prevent negative balance
            raise ValueError("Balance cannot be negative!")
        print(f"Updating balance to ${value}")  # Optional logging
        self._balance = value  # Updates the stored value

    @balance.deleter
    def balance(self):  # Deleter: Controls deletion
        print("Resetting balance to zero!")  # Optional logging
        self._balance = 0  # Resets balance instead of deleting
 ```

### Encapsulation Patterns

Property decorators enable encapsulation by allowing controlled access to private attributes, facilitating validation and computation upon access or assignment.

### Validation Strategies

Setters can include validation logic to ensure that only appropriate values are assigned to attributes, enhancing data integrity.

### Computed Properties

Properties can compute values dynamically, providing a way to present derived data as attributes without storing them explicitly.

### Property Inheritance

Properties are inherited like regular methods. Subclasses can override property methods to change behavior while maintaining the interface.

## 5. JSON Serialization

#### What is JSON Serialization?

JSON Serialization is the process of converting a data structure (like an object, dictionary, array, or list) into a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) string. This allows the data to be easily stored, transmitted, or shared between systems.

The reverse process (deserialization) converts a JSON string back into a usable data structure.

#### Why is JSON Serialization Used?

    Data Exchange – JSON is a lightweight, text-based format used in APIs (REST, GraphQL) and web services.

    Storage – Serialized JSON can be saved in databases or files.

    Cross-Language Compatibility – Almost all programming languages support JSON parsing.

### Handling Custom Object Serialization

Python's `json` module does not natively support serializing custom objects. To handle this, you can:

- **Custom Encoder**: Subclass `json.JSONEncoder` and override the `default` method to convert custom objects into serializable formats.

- **Custom Decoder**: Use the `object_hook` parameter in `json.loads` to define how JSON objects are converted back into custom Python objects.

### Complex Object Handling

For complex objects, define a method (e.g., `to_dict`) that returns a serializable representation. Use this method within the custom encoder to handle serialization.

### Circular References

The `json` module cannot handle circular references and will raise a `RecursionError`. To manage this, you can:

- Avoid circular references in your data structures.

- Use third-party libraries like `jsonpickle` that can handle circular references.

- Implement custom logic in your encoder to detect and handle circular references. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### Performance Considerations

Serialization performance can be improved by:

- Using faster third-party libraries like `ujson` or `orjson`.

- Avoiding unnecessary serialization of large or complex objects.

- Caching serialized representations if the same data is serialized multiple times.

## 6. Type Hints and Generics

Type hints (also called type annotations) allow you to explicitly specify the expected types of variables, function parameters, and return values.
    
 - Type hints = Labels for types (str, int, etc.).

 - Optional/Union/Literal = Special cases ("or None", "either A or B", etc.).

 - Generics = A way to reuse type-safe code for different types (List[T], Dict[K, V]). Generics don’t replace other type hints—they make them more powerful!

### Use of Generic Types and `TypeVar`

Generics allow you to write flexible and reusable code by parameterizing types. `TypeVar` is used to define a generic type variable, enabling functions and classes to operate on different types while maintaining type safety.

### Generic Type Patterns

Common patterns include:

- **Generic Classes**: Classes that can operate on different types, such as a `Stack[T]` that can hold elements of any type `T`.

- **Generic Functions**: Functions that can accept and return values of generic types.

### Type Constraints

You can constrain `TypeVar` to specific types using the `bound` parameter, ensuring that only subclasses of a particular type are allowed. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### Collection Types

Generics are particularly useful with collection types, allowing you to specify the type of elements within lists, dictionaries, etc., enhancing type checking and code clarity.

### Bounded Types

Bounded `TypeVar` ensures that the generic type adheres to a specific interface or base class, enabling more precise type checking and preventing misuse.

 
# Generic Type Example: A Reusable Container

```python
from typing import Generic, TypeVar

T = TypeVar('T')

class Container(Generic[T]):
    """A type-safe container that works with any type."""
    def __init__(self, content: T):
        self.content = content
    
    def get(self) -> T:
        return self.content
```

## Key Features
- **Type Safety**: The container preserves the type of its contents
- **Reusability**: Works with `int`, `str`, or any other type
- **Static Checking**: Tools like `mypy` will catch type errors

## Usage
```python
# Stores an integer
int_box: Container[int] = Container(42)
value = int_box.get()  # Type checker knows this is int

# Stores a string
str_box: Container[str] = Container("Hello")
value = str_box.get()  # Type checker knows this is str
```

 ### 7. Context Managers

Context managers in Python are used to manage resources such as file streams, network connections, and locks in a clean and safe way. They ensure that resources are properly acquired and released, even in the case of errors. The most common way to use context managers is via the `with` statement.

#### Class-based Implementation

A class can be turned into a context manager by implementing two special methods: `__enter__()` and `__exit__()`.

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start = time.time()
        print("Timer started.")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.end = time.time()
        self.interval = self.end - self.start
        print(f"Timer ended. Duration: {self.interval:.4f} seconds")
```

Usage:

```python
with Timer() as t:
    # some time-consuming operations
    time.sleep(2)
```

#### Decorator-based Implementation

Python also provides a more concise way to write context managers using the `@contextmanager` decorator from the `contextlib` module.

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager
import tempfile
import shutil
import os

@contextmanager
def temp_directory():
    path = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    print(f"Created temporary directory at {path}")
    try:
        yield path
    finally:
        shutil.rmtree(path)
        print(f"Deleted temporary directory at {path}")
```

Usage:

```python
with temp_directory() as tmp_dir:
    print(f"Working inside: {tmp_dir}")
    # do something in the temp dir
```

#### Key Benefits

- **Resource Safety**: Ensures deterministic release of resources.
- **Error Handling**: Always executes cleanup code, even when exceptions are raised.
- **Code Readability**: Isolates setup and teardown code from business logic.
- **Composable**: Supports nested and multiple context managers.
